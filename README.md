# Food-ordering-system
The repository contains the program that fulfills following expectations:
 Create only command-line interface (no UI is required)
 It’s possible to order lunch or drink via command-line interface
 There are three cuisines available to choose from (Polish, Mexican, Italian)
 Lunch consists of the main course and dessert
 When ordering a drink, the customer can additionally ask for ice cubes or/and lemon
 We must have getPrice() and getName() methods for each meal and drink
 The solution you come up with should be extendable (it should be possible to add
new cuisines/dishes in the future)
